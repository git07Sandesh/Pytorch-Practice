# 🧠 PyTorch Learning Journey (with FreeCodeCamp)

This repository is a collection of notes, code snippets, and small projects I created while learning PyTorch through FreeCodeCamp's tutorials.

It covers the basics of deep learning, including:

- Working with tensors
- Automatic differentiation
- Building neural networks
- Training and evaluating models

I'm using this repo to document my progress and get hands-on practice with PyTorch concepts.
